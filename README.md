## Features

### Steam-Like Subscription Based Downloading and Installing
MTGO Launcher offers a subscription-based model similar to Steam, allowing users to access and download mods seamlessly. This feature streamlines the process of acquiring and installing mods, making it more convenient and user-friendly.


### Multiple Mod Profiles with Separate User-Profiles
MTGO Launcher introduces the concept of multiple mod profiles, allowing users to create and manage different sets of mods for their games. Each mod profile can have its own separate user-profiles, enabling users to customize their experience for different gameplay styles or preferences.

### Auto Updates for Mods
Stay up-to-date effortlessly with the auto update feature of MTGO Launcher. When a new version of a mod is released, the launcher will automatically download and install the latest version, ensuring that you always have the most current enhancements and fixes.

### Seamless Management of Mods for MTGA and SPT-AKI
MTGO Launcher simplifies the management of mods by providing the ability to handle mods from both Make Tarkov Great Again and SPT-AKI separately. This dual compatibility allows users to organize and customize their mods for each emu independently. Additionally, the launcher enables users to switch between these two games effortlessly, eliminating the hassle of navigating through multiple interfaces.

### Cross Emulation
MTGO Launcher serves as a unified platform for both SPT-AKI and MTGA, enabling users to conveniently select, download, install, and cross-launch mods for either game. This centralized approach simplifies the modding experience by offering a single launcher for multiple emulators, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

! Right now this is a prototype, a proof of concept. A backend server has not been made yet. As such, no functionality is ready.

## Known issues



None at the moment.



## Who are we, and why are we doing this?



MTGA is a organization founded by a few Altered Escape developers.



We felt that there shouldn't just be one option for emulation and began development on MTGA, but for our launcher, we decided we dont want to keep thease features to ourselves, and so we decided to expand to allow our launcher, and mod managment system to work with SPT-AKI aswell,

We are developing this launcher to offer an accessible experience to all those in the tarkov offline scene.
