## Who are we, and why are we doing this?

Make Tarkov Great Again is a project founded by a few Altered Escape developers. We felt that there shouldn't just be one option for Tarkov offline play and began development on MTGA.

We are developing this launcher to offer an accessible experience to all those in the EmuTarkov Scene.
